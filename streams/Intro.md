# Introducing Patchy

Hi, I'm **Patchy**, your friendly patch for comparing and managing diffs in VS Code!

I can help you with the following commands:

- **Introduce Patchy** (`/intro`): I'll introduce myself and explain what I can do for you.
- **Start the diff process** (`/compare`): Kick off the process to compare changes in your files.

Available after (`compare`) command:

- **Confirm the diff process** (`/confirm`): Confirm and move forward with the diff process.
- **Complete the diff process** (`/complete`): Wrap up and complete the diff process.
- **Cancel the diff process** (`/cancel`): Stop the diff process before completion.
- **Abort the diff process** (`/abort`): Immediately abort the diff process.

Let's get patching and make those diffs seamless!
